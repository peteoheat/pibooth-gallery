# pibooth-gallery
PiBooth Gallery is a module created for pibooth to create a web gallery with thumbnails of the images created on the booth
it works alongside pibooth-qrcode which creates the QR code that can be used to download the image, 
but also provides a simple download button and a share button to enable sharing via whatsapp etc on a mobile device.
